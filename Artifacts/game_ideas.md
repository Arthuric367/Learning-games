# Game Ideas & Style Review

## Style Review
The current application has a strong, kid-friendly foundation.
*   **Strengths**:
    *   **Visuals**: Bright colors, large text, and consistent use of emojis make it accessible for 5-year-olds.
    *   **Feedback**: Audio feedback (speech and sounds) and visual effects (explosions, shakes) are excellent for engagement.
    *   **Navigation**: Simple "Back to Menu" flow is easy to understand.
*   **Suggestions**:
    *   **Unified UI**: Ensure the "Home/Back" button is in a consistent location across all games (e.g., top-left corner) to build muscle memory.
    *   **Animations**: Add subtle animations to the Main Menu cards (e.g., slight bounce on hover) to make them feel more "alive".
    *   **Accessibility**: Ensure high contrast for text, especially on colorful backgrounds.
